# Enum [tauri](/docs/api/rust/tauri/index.html)::​[WindowEvent](/docs/api/rust/tauri/)

```rs
#[non_exhaustive]pub enum WindowEvent {
    Resized(PhysicalSize<u32>),
    Moved(PhysicalPosition<i32>),
    CloseRequested,
    Destroyed,
    Focused(bool),
    ScaleFactorChanged {
        scale_factor: f64,
        new_inner_size: PhysicalSize<u32>,
    },
}
```

An event from a window.

## Variants (Non-exhaustive)

Non-exhaustive enums could have additional variants added in future. Therefore, when matching against variants of non-exhaustive enums, an extra wildcard arm must be added to account for any future variants.

`Resized(PhysicalSize<u32>)`

The size of the window has changed. Contains the client area’s new dimensions.

`Moved(PhysicalPosition<i32>)`

The position of the window has changed. Contains the window’s new position.

`CloseRequested`

The window has been requested to close.

`Destroyed`

The window has been destroyed.

`Focused(bool)`

The window gained or lost focus.

The parameter is true if the window has gained focus, and false if it has lost focus.

`ScaleFactorChanged`

The window’s scale factor has changed.

The following user actions can cause DPI changes:

-   Changing the display’s resolution.
-   Changing the display’s scale factor (e.g. in Control Panel on Windows).
-   Moving the window to a display with a different scale factor.

### Fields of **ScaleFactorChanged**

`scale_factor: f64`

The new scale factor.

`new_inner_size: PhysicalSize<u32>`

The window inner size.
