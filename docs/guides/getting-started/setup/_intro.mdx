Tauri is a framework to build desktop applications with any Front-end framework and a Rust core. Each app consists of two parts:

1. Rust binary that creates the windows and exposes native functionality to those windows
2. Frontend of your choice that produces the User Interface inside the window

In the following, we will first scaffold the Frontend, then set up the Rust project and lastly show you how to communicate between the two.

<span>
{ !props.useCargo &&
<Admonition type="tip" title={<code>create-tauri-app</code>}>

The easiest way to scaffold a new project is the [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app) utility. It will ask you a series of questions and quickly bootstrap a Tauri project for you to begin developing with. It has support for vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript but also many frontend frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte.
