:::info

Before we continue, make sure you have completed the [prerequisites] to have a working development environment.

:::

Tauri is a framework to build desktop applications with any frontend framework and a Rust core. Each app consists of two parts:

1. Rust binary that creates the windows and exposes native functionality to those windows
2. Frontend of your choice that produces the user interface inside the window

In the following, we will first scaffold the frontend, set up the Rust project, and lastly show you how to communicate between the two.

:::tip `create-tauri-app`

The easiest way to scaffold a new project is the [`create-tauri-app`] utility. It provides opiniated templates for vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript and many frontend frameworks like React, Svelte, and Yew.

Please note that you do not need to follow the rest of this guide if you use `create-tauri-app`, but we still recommend reading it to understand the setup.
