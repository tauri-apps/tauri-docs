# HTML/CSS/JavaScript

This guide will walk you through creating your first Tauri app using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is probably the best place to start if you are new to web development.

<Intro />

Here's a preview of what we will be building:

Before we continue, make sure you have completed the [prerequisites] and installed the [Tauri CLI][tauri-cli] to have a working development environment.

## Create the Frontend

We will create a very minimal UI using an HTML file. To keep things tidy though, let's create a separate folder for it:

```shell
mkdir ui
```

Next, create an `index.html` file inside of that folder with the following contents:

```html title=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
    />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome from Tauri!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

We will leave the UI at this for this Guide, but feel free to play around with more content or add styling through CSS.

<TauriInit
  webAssets="For the sake of this tutorial we will answer this with '../ui'."
  devServer="Because we don't use a frontend bundler with Hot Module Reloading (HMR) for this tutorial we will answer with the same path as the previous question: '../ui'."
/>

And that's it! Now you can run the following command in your terminal to start a development build of your app:

<Command name="dev" />

![html-css-js-light](/img/guides/html-css-js-dev-light.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![html-css-js-dark](/img/guides/html-css-js-dev-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

## Invoke Commands

<Commands />

We would normally be recommending the [`@tauri-apps/api`] package here, but since we're not using a bundler for this guide, please enable [`withGlobalTauri`] in your `tauri.conf.json` file:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "beforeBuildCommand": "",
    "beforeDevCommand": "",
    "devPath": "..",
    "distDir": "..",
    // highlight-next-line
    "withGlobalTauri": true
  },
```

This will inject a pre-bundled version of the API functions into your frontend.

You can now modify your `index.html` file to call your Command:

```html title=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
    />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome from Tauri!</h1>
    // highlight-start
    <script>
      // access the pre-bundled global API functions
      const invoke = window.__TAURI__.invoke

      // now we can call our Command!
      // Right-click the application background and open the developer tools.
      // You will see "Hello, World!" printed in the console!
      invoke('greet', { name: 'World' })
        // `invoke` returns a Promise
        .then((response) => console.log(response))
    </script>
    // highlight-end
  </body>
</html>
```
