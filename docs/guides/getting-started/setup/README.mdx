# Quick Start

Tauri is compatible with **almost every frontend stack**. Select yours and get started!

If you're unfamiliar with web development or have no favorite frontend stack you might find the [HTML/CSS/JS] guide the most helpful. It guides you through getting started with the most minimal frontend setup possible using either Node or Cargo.

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />
