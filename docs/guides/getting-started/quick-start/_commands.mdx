Tauri lets you enhance your Frontend with native capabilities. We call
these [Commands][command], essentially Rust functions that you can
call from your frontend JavaScript. This enables you to handle heavy
processing or calls to the OS in much more performant Rust code.

Let's make a simple example:

```rust
#[tauri::command]
fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
   format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}
```

A Command is just like any regular Rust function, with the addition of
the `#[tauri::command]` attribute macro that allows your function to
communicate with the JavaScript context.

Lastly, we also need to tell Tauri about our newly created command so
that it can route calls accordingly. This is done with the combination
of the `.invoke_handler()` function and the `generate_handler![]`
macro you can see below:

```rust
fn main() {
  tauri::Builder::default()
  // highlight-next-line
    .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![greet])
    .run(tauri::generate_context!())
    .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

Now we're ready to call your Command from the JavaScript frontend!
