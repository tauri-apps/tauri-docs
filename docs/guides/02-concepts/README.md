Now that you have completed the Quick Start and have a basic Tauri application at hand, it is tempting to jump right in. We invite you, however, to resist this temptation for a couple more pages and learn more about the concepts and ideas behind Tauri. You will find developing an app is much like creating a traditional client-server application on the web, with a couple of subtle but important differences.

This section will cover Tauris multi-process architecture, windows, and webviews and our design decisions to make your application more secure and resource efficient.
