# Next.js

This guide will walk you through creating your first Tauri app using the React framework [Next.js][].

<Intro />

Ecco un'anteprima di quello che costruiremo:

## Crea il Frontend

[Next.js][] is a React Framework that comes with both Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static-Site Generation (SSG) capabilities. To make Next.js work with Tauri we are going to use the SSG mode since it generates only static files that can be included in the final binary.

Next.js comes with a scaffolding utility similar to [`create-tauri-app`][] that can quickly setup a new project from many pre-defined templates. For this guide, we will use the suggested default for all questions, including TypeScript support and the new `App Router` feature stabilized in v13.4. In case you use the the old `routes/` directory instead or on top of the `app/` directory, you still need to change the config as explained in the [Next.js Static Exports](#nextjs-static-exports) section but the way you use Tauri specific JS APIs will be different than described below.

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest --use-npm
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Yarn">

```shell
yarn create next-app --use-yarn
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```shell
pnpm create next-app --use-pnpm
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

1. _Project name_  
   This will be the name of your project. It corresponds to the name of the folder this utility will create but has otherwise no effect on your app. È possibile utilizzare il nome che si desidera.

## Next.js Static Exports

Because Tauri does not have a Node.js runtime you must set Next.js to SSG/SPA mode. This will typically result in faster page loads but also has a few caveats to be aware of, therefore we recommend to carefully read through Next.js' official docs on [Static Exports][].

These docs also show one required configuration change we will always have to change for a Tauri + Next.js app. To do this, edit the `next.config.js` file in the project's root directory and add the following:

```js title=next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

This will change the behavior of the `next build` to produce an `out/` folder containing the HTML/CSS/JS assets for your application instead of writing them to a `.next/` directory specific to Next.js' runtime.

There are a few more possible configuration options, so make sure to read through the [Static Exports][] docs as mentioned above and adapt the configuration file according to the needs of your project.

## Crea il progetto Rust

<TauriInit destDirExplination={{ __html: 'Use <code>../out</code> for this value.' }} devPathExplination={{ __html: 'Use <code>http://localhost:3000</code> for this value.', }} beforeBuildCommandExplination={{ __html: 'Use <code>npm run build</code> for this value (make sure to adapt this to use the package manager of your choice).', }} beforeDevCommandExplination={{ __html: 'Use <code>npm run dev</code> for this value (make sure to adapt this to use the package manager of your choice).', }} />

Now that we have scaffolded our frontend and initialized the Rust project you're almost ready to run your app. Your `tauri.conf.json` file should look something like this:

```json title=src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
{
  "build": {
    "beforeBuildCommand": "npm run build",
    "beforeDevCommand": "npm run dev",
    "devPath": "http://localhost:3000",
    "distDir": "../out"
  },
```

E questo è tutto! Ora puoi eseguire il seguente comando nel terminale per avviare una build di sviluppo della tua app:

<Command name="dev" />

![Finestra Dell'Applicazione](/img/guides/getting-started/setup/next-js/next-js-dev-light.png#gh-light-mode-only) ![Finestra Dell'Applicazione](/img/guides/getting-started/setup/next-js/next-js-dev-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

## Invoca Comandi

<Commands />

To call our newly created command we will use the [`@tauri-apps/api`][] JavaScript library. It provides access to core functionality such as window manipulation, the filesystem, and more through convenient JavaScript abstractions. È possibile installarlo utilizzando il gestore di pacchetti JavaScript preferito:

<InstallTauriApi />

One important thing to note is that all of Tauri's JS APIs require access to browser-only APIs which means they can only be used in [Client Components][]. If you don't need Server Components you can add `'use client'` at the very top of the `app/page.tsx` file, in this guide however, we will create a separate component so that we don't have to convert the whole app.

```tsx title=app/greet.tsx
'use client'

import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/tauri'

export default function Greet() {
  useEffect(() => {
    invoke<string>('greet', { name: 'Next.js' })
      .then(console.log)
      .catch(console.error)
  }, [])

  // Necessary because we will have to use Greet as a component later.
  return <></>
}
```

Now we will use this component in the default `Home` component in `app/page.tsx`. Note that it must be in the actual component tree and can't be a simple function call as long as the parent (in this case the `Home` component) is a Server Component.

```tsx title=app/page.tsx
// ...
import Greet from './greet'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      // highlight-next-line
      <Greet />
      ...
    </main>
  )
}
```
