# Prerequisites

## Installing

The first step is to install [Rust] and system dependencies. Keep in mind that this setup is only needed for _developing Tauri apps_. Your end-users are not required to do any of this.

### Setting Up Windows

#### 1. Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools

You will need to install Microsoft Visual Studio C++ build tools. The easiest way is to install [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022]. When asked which workloads to install, ensure "C++ build tools" and the Windows 10 SDK are selected.

#### 2. WebView2

<Callout kind="note">
  On Windows 10 (Version 1803 and later with all updates applied) and Windows
  11, the Webview2 runtime is distributed as part of the operating system.
</Callout>

Tauri heavily depends on WebView2 to render web content on Windows, therefore you must have WebView2 installed. The easiest way is to download and run the Evergreen Bootstrapper from [Microsoft's website][download webview2].

The bootstrapper script will try to determine the correct architecture and version for your system. Still, if you run into issues (especially with Windows on ARM) you can select the correct standalone installer.

#### 3. Rust

Lastly, go to [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install][install rust] to install `rustup` (the Rust installer). Note that you have to restart your terminal, and in some cases, Windows itself, for the changes to take effect.

Alternatively, you could use `winget` to install rustup using the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
winget install --id Rustlang.Rustup
```

<Callout kind="caution" title="MSVC toolchain as default">
For full support for Tauri and tools like [`trunk`] make sure the MSVC Rust toolchain is the selected `default host triple` in the installer dialog. Depending on your system it should be either `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, `i686-pc-windows-msvc`, or `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`.

If you already have Rust installed, you can make sure the correct toolchain is installed by running this command:

```powershell
rustup default stable-msvc
```

</Callout>

### Setting Up macOS

#### 1. CLang and macOS Development Dependencies

You will need to install CLang and macOS development dependencies. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

#### 2. Rust

To install Rust on macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

<Callout kind="note">
  We have audited this bash script, and it does what it says it is supposed to
  do. Nevertheless, before blindly curl-bashing a script, it is always wise to
  look at it first. Here is the file as a plain script: [rustup.sh]
</Callout>

The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the `rustup` tool, which installs the latest stable version of Rust. You might be prompted for your password. If the installation was
successful, the following line will appear:

```
Rust is installed now. Great!
```

Make sure to restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

### Setting Up Linux

#### 1. System Dependencies

You will need to install a couple of system dependencies, such as a C compiler and `webkit2gtk`. Below are commands for a few popular distributions:

<Tabs tabTitles={["Debian", "Arch", "Fedora", "openSUSE", "NixOS"]}>
  <div slot="Debian">
  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    wget \
    libssl-dev \
    libgtk-3-dev \
    libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
    librsvg2-dev
```
  </div>
  <div slot="Arch">
  ```sh
  sudo pacman -Syu
  sudo pacman -S --needed \
    webkit2gtk \
    base-devel \
    curl \
    wget \
    openssl \
    appmenu-gtk-module \
    gtk3 \
    libappindicator-gtk3 \
    librsvg \
    libvips
```
  </div>
  <div slot="Fedora">
  ```sh
  sudo dnf check-update
  sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.0-devel \
    openssl-devel \
    curl \
    wget \
    libappindicator-gtk3 \
    librsvg2-devel
  sudo dnf group install "C Development Tools and Libraries"
```

Note that on Fedora 36 and below the `webkit2gtk4.0-devel` package was called `webkit2gtk3-devel`.

  </div>
  <div slot="openSUSE">
  ```sh
  sudo zypper up
  sudo zypper in webkit2gtk3-soup2-devel \
    libopenssl-devel \
    curl \
    wget \
    libappindicator3-1 \
    librsvg-devel
  sudo zypper in -t pattern devel_basis
```
  </div>
  <div slot="NixOS">
  Working on NixOS requires a slightly different setup, as Tauri needs to find the required system libraries both at compile time and
dynamically at runtime. To make them available to Tauri the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable needs to be populated with the correct paths.

When using [Nix Flakes], copy the following code into `flake.nix` on your repository, then run `nix develop` to activate the development environment. You can also use [direnv's Flakes integration] to automatically start the dev shell when entering the project folder.

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "nixpkgs";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};

        libraries = with pkgs;[
          webkitgtk
          gtk3
          cairo
          gdk-pixbuf
          glib
          dbus
          openssl_3
        ];

        packages = with pkgs; [
          curl
          wget
          pkg-config
          dbus
          openssl_3
          glib
          gtk3
          libsoup
          webkitgtk
        ];
      in
      {
        devShell = pkgs.mkShell {
          buildInputs = packages;

          shellHook =
            ''
              export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${pkgs.lib.makeLibraryPath libraries}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
            '';
        };
      });
}
```

If you don't use Nix Flakes, the [Nix Shell] can be configured using the following `shell.nix` script. Run `nix-shell` to activate the development environment, or use [direnv's Shell integration] to automatically start the dev shell when entering the project folder.

```nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { };

  libraries = with pkgs;[
    webkitgtk
    gtk3
    cairo
    gdk-pixbuf
    glib
    dbus
    openssl_3
  ];

  packages = with pkgs; [
    pkg-config
    dbus
    openssl_3
    glib
    gtk3
    libsoup
    webkitgtk
    appimagekit
  ];
in
pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = packages;

  shellHook =
    ''
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${pkgs.lib.makeLibraryPath libraries}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    '';
}
```

  </div>
</Tabs>

#### 2. Rust

To install Rust on Linux, open a terminal and enter the following command:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

<Callout kind="note">
  We have audited this bash script, and it does what it says it is supposed to
  do. Nevertheless, before blindly curl-bashing a script, it is always wise to
  look at it first. Here is the file as a plain script: [rustup.sh]
</Callout>

The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the `rustup` tool, which installs the latest stable version of Rust. You might be prompted for your password. If the installation was successful, the following line will appear:

```
Rust is installed now. Great!
```

Make sure to restart your Terminal for the changes to take effect.

## Managing The Rust Installation

You should keep your Rust version up to date whenever possible to always benefit from the latest improvements. To update Rust, open a terminal and run the following command:

```shell
rustup update
```

`rustup` can also be used to uninstall Rust from your machine fully:

```shell
rustup self uninstall
```

## Troubleshooting

To check whether you have Rust installed correctly, open a shell and enter this command:

```shell
rustc --version
```

You should see the version number, commit hash, and commit date for the latest stable version that has been released in the following format:

```
rustc x.y.z (abcabcabc yyyy-mm-dd)
```

If you don't see this information, your Rust installation might be broken. Please consult [Rust's Troubleshooting Section] on how to fix this. If your problems persist, you can get help from the official [Tauri Discord] and [GitHub Discussions].
