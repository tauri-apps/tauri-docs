Tauri applications for Windows are either distributed as Microsoft Installers (`.msi` files) using the [WiX Toolset v3]
or as setup executables (`-setup.exe` files) using [NSIS].

Please note that `.msi` installers can **only be created on Windows** as cross-compilation doesn't work.
Cross-compilation for NSIS installers is currently experimental.

This guide provides information about available customization options for the installer.

## Building

To build and bundle your app into a Windows installer you can use the Tauri CLI and run the `tauri build` command in a Windows computer:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build"
  yarn="yarn tauri build"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build"
  cargo="cargo tauri build"
/>

### Experimental: Build Windows apps on Linux and macOS

Cross compiling Windows apps on Linux and macOS hosts is possible when using [NSIS].
Note that this is currently considered highly experimental and may not work on every system or for every project.
Therefore it should only be used as a last resort if local VMs or CI solutions like GitHub Actions don't work for you.

:::note
Signing cross compiled Windows installers requires an external signing tool.
See the [signing documentation] for more information.
:::

Since Tauri officially only supports the MSVC Windows target, the setup is a bit more involved.

#### Install NSIS

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Linux">
Some Linux distributions have NSIS available in their repositories, for example on Ubuntu you can install NSIS by running this command:

```sh title=Ubuntu
sudo apt install nsis
```

But on many other distributions you have to compile NSIS yourself or download Stubs and Plugins manually that weren't included in the distro's binary package.
Fedora for example only provides the binary but not the Stubs and Plugins:

```sh title=Fedora
sudo dnf in mingw64-nsis
wget https://github.com/tauri-apps/binary-releases/releases/download/nsis-3/nsis-3.zip
unzip nsis-3.zip
sudo cp nsis-3.08/Stubs/* /usr/share/nsis/Stubs/
sudo cp -r nsis-3.08/Plugins/** /usr/share/nsis/Plugins/
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="macOS">
On macOS you will need [Homebrew] to install NSIS:

```sh title=macOS
brew install nsis
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Install LLVM and the LLD Linker

Since the default Microsoft linker only works on Windows we will also need to install a new linker.
To compile the Windows Resource file which is used for setting the app icon among other things
we will also need the `llvm-rc` binary which is part of the LLVM project.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Linux">
  
```sh title="Ubuntu"
sudo apt install lld llvm
```

On Linux you also need to install the `clang` package if you added dependencies that compile C/C++ dependencies as part of their build scripts.
Default Tauri apps should not require this.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="macOS">
```sh title=macOS
brew install llvm
```

On macOS you also have to add `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin` to your `$PATH` as suggested in the install output.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Install the Windows Rust target

Assuming you're building for 64-bit Windows systems:

```sh
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

#### Install `cargo-xwin`

Instead of setting the Windows SDKs up manually we will use [`cargo-xwin`] as Tauri's "runner":

```sh
cargo install --locked cargo-xwin
```

By default `cargo-xwin` will download the Windows SDKs into a project-local folder.
If you have multiple projects and want to share those files you can set the `XWIN_CACHE_DIR` environment variable with a path to the preferred location.

#### Building the App

Now it should be as simple as adding the runner and target to the `tauri build` command:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build --runner cargo-xwin --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
  yarn="yarn tauri build --runner cargo-xwin --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build --runner cargo-xwin --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
  cargo="cargo tauri build --runner cargo-xwin --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
/>

The build output will then be in `target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/bundle/nsis/`.

### Building for 32-bit or ARM

The Tauri CLI compiles your executable using your machine's architecture by default.
Assuming that you're developing on a 64-bit machine, the CLI will produce 64-bit applications.

If you need to support **32-bit** machines, you can compile your application with a **different** [Rust target][platform support]
using the `--target` flag:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build --target i686-pc-windows-msvc"
  yarn="yarn tauri build --target i686-pc-windows-msvc"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build --target i686-pc-windows-msvc"
  cargo="cargo tauri build --target i686-pc-windows-msvc"
/>

By default, Rust only installs toolchains for your machine's target,
so you need to install the 32-bit Windows toolchain first: `rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc`.

If you need to build for **ARM64** you first need to install additional build tools.
To do this, open `Visual Studio Installer`, click on "Modify", and in the "Individual Components" tab install the "C++ ARM64 build tools".
At the time of writing, the exact name in VS2022 is `MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ ARM64 build tools (Latest)`.  
Now you can add the rust target with `rustup target add aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` and then use the above-mentioned method to compile your app:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc"
  yarn="yarn tauri build --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc"
  cargo="cargo tauri build --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc"
/>

:::info

Only the NSIS target supports ARM64 targets, so if you configured Tauri to compile all bundle types
you may want to change the above command to `tauri build --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc --bundles nsis` to only build the NSIS installer.

Note that the installer itself will still be x86 running on the ARM machine via emulation. The app itself will be a native ARM64 binary.

:::

## Supporting Windows 7

By default, the Microsoft Installer (`.msi`) does not work on Windows 7 because it needs to download the WebView2 bootstrapper if not installed
(which might fail if TLS 1.2 is not enabled in the operating system). Tauri includes an option to embed the WebView2 bootstrapper
(see the [Embedding the WebView2 Bootstrapper](#embedded-bootstrapper) section below).
The NSIS based installer (`-setup.exe`) also supports the `downloadBootstrapper` mode on Windows 7.

Additionally, to use the Notification API in Windows 7, you need to enable the `windows7-compat` Cargo feature:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-notification = { version = "2.0.0-rc", features = [ "windows7-compat" ] }
```

## FIPS Compliance

If your system requires the MSI bundle to be FIPS compliant you can set the `TAURI_FIPS_COMPLIANT` environment variable to `true`
before running `tauri build`. In PowerShell you can set it for the current terminal session like this:

```powershell
$env:TAURI_FIPS_COMPLIANT="true"
```

## WebView2 Installation Options

The installers by default download the WebView2 bootstrapper and executes it if the runtime is not installed.
Alternatively, you can embed the bootstrapper, embed the offline installer, or use a fixed WebView2 runtime version.
See the following table for a comparison between these methods:

| Installation Method                                | Requires Internet Connection? | Additional Installer Size | Notes                                                                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`downloadBootstrapper`](#downloaded-bootstrapper) | Yes                           | 0MB                       | `Default` <br /> Results in a smaller installer size, but is not recommended for Windows 7 deployment via `.msi` files. |
| [`embedBootstrapper`](#embedded-bootstrapper)      | Yes                           | ~1.8MB                    | Better support on Windows 7 for `.msi` installers.                                                                      |
| [`offlineInstaller`](#offline-installer)           | No                            | ~127MB                    | Embeds WebView2 installer. Recommended for offline environments.                                                        |
| [`fixedVersion`](#fixed-version)                   | No                            | ~180MB                    | Embeds a fixed WebView2 version.                                                                                        |
| [`skip`](#skipping-installation)                   | No                            | 0MB                       | ⚠️ Not recommended <br /> Does not install the WebView2 as part of the Windows Installer.                               |

:::info

On Windows 10 (April 2018 release or later) and Windows 11, the WebView2 runtime is distributed as part of the operating system.

:::

### Downloaded Bootstrapper

This is the default setting for building the Windows Installer. It downloads the bootstrapper and runs it.
Requires an internet connection but results in a smaller installer size.
This is not recommended if you're going to be distributing to Windows 7 via `.msi` installers.

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "webviewInstallMode": {
        "type": "downloadBootstrapper"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Embedded Bootstrapper

To embed the WebView2 Bootstrapper, set the [webviewInstallMode] to `embedBootstrapper`.
This increases the installer size by around 1.8MB, but increases compatibility with Windows 7 systems.

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "webviewInstallMode": {
        "type": "embedBootstrapper"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Offline Installer

To embed the WebView2 Bootstrapper, set the [webviewInstallMode] to `offlineInstaller`.
This increases the installer size by around 127MB, but allows your application to be installed even if an internet connection is not available.

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "webviewInstallMode": {
        "type": "offlineInstaller"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Fixed Version

Using the runtime provided by the system is great for security as the webview vulnerability patches are managed by Windows.
If you want to control the WebView2 distribution on each of your applications
(either to manage the release patches yourself or distribute applications on environments where an internet connection might not be available)
Tauri can bundle the runtime files for you.

:::caution

Distributing a fixed WebView2 Runtime version increases the Windows Installer by around 180MB.

:::

1. Download the WebView2 fixed version runtime from [Microsoft's website][download-webview2-runtime].
   In this example, the downloaded filename is `Microsoft.WebView2.FixedVersionRuntime.128.0.2739.42.x64.cab`
2. Extract the file to the core folder:

```powershell
Expand .\Microsoft.WebView2.FixedVersionRuntime.128.0.2739.42.x64.cab -F:* ./src-tauri
```

3. Configure the WebView2 runtime path in `tauri.conf.json`:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "webviewInstallMode": {
        "type": "fixedRuntime",
        "path": "./Microsoft.WebView2.FixedVersionRuntime.98.0.1108.50.x64/"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Run `tauri build` to produce the Windows Installer with the fixed WebView2 runtime.

### Skipping Installation

You can remove the WebView2 Runtime download check from the installer by setting [webviewInstallMode] to `skip`.
Your application WILL NOT work if the user does not have the runtime installed.

:::warning

Your application WILL NOT work if the user does not have the runtime installed and won't attempt to install it.

:::

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "webviewInstallMode": {
        "type": "skip"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Customizing the WiX Installer

See the [WiX configuration] for the complete list of customization options.

### Installer Template

The `.msi` Windows Installer package is built using the [WiX Toolset v3].
Currently, apart from pre-defined [configurations][WiX configuration], you can change it by using a custom WiX source code
(an XML file with a `.wxs` file extension) or through WiX fragments.

#### Replacing the Installer Code with a Custom WiX File

The Windows Installer XML defined by Tauri is configured to work for the common use case
of simple webview-based applications (you can find it [here][default wix template]).
It uses [handlebars] so the Tauri CLI can brand your installer according to your `tauri.conf.json` definition.
If you need a completely different installer, a custom template file can be configured on [`tauri.bundle.windows.wix.template`].

#### Extending the Installer with WiX Fragments

A [WiX fragment] is a container where you can configure almost everything offered by WiX.
In this example, we will define a fragment that writes two registry entries:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Wix xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/2006/wi">
  <Fragment>
    <!-- these registry entries should be installed
		 to the target user's machine -->
    <DirectoryRef Id="TARGETDIR">
      <!-- groups together the registry entries to be installed -->
      <!-- Note the unique `Id` we provide here -->
      <Component Id="MyFragmentRegistryEntries" Guid="*">
        <!-- the registry key will be under
			 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MyCompany\MyApplicationName -->
        <!-- Tauri uses the second portion of the
			 bundle identifier as the `MyCompany` name
			 (e.g. `tauri-apps` in `com.tauri-apps.test`)  -->
        <RegistryKey
          Root="HKCU"
          Key="Software\MyCompany\MyApplicationName"
          Action="createAndRemoveOnUninstall"
        >
          <!-- values to persist on the registry -->
          <RegistryValue
            Type="integer"
            Name="SomeIntegerValue"
            Value="1"
            KeyPath="yes"
          />
          <RegistryValue Type="string" Value="Default Value" />
        </RegistryKey>
      </Component>
    </DirectoryRef>
  </Fragment>
</Wix>
```

Save the fragment file with the `.wxs` extension in the `src-tauri/windows/fragments` folder and reference it on `tauri.conf.json`:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "wix": {
        "fragmentPaths": ["./windows/fragments/registry.wxs"],
        "componentRefs": ["MyFragmentRegistryEntries"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that `ComponentGroup`, `Component`, `FeatureGroup`, `Feature` and `Merge` element ids must be referenced on the `wix` object
of `tauri.conf.json` on the `componentGroupRefs`, `componentRefs`, `featureGroupRefs`, `featureRefs` and `mergeRefs`
respectively to be included in the installer.

### Internationalization

The WiX Installer is built using the `en-US` language by default.
Internationalization (i18n) can be configured using the [`tauri.bundle.windows.wix.language`] property,
defining the languages Tauri should build an installer against.
You can find the language names to use in the Language-Culture column on [Microsoft's website][localizing the error and actiontext tables].

#### Compiling a WiX Installer for a Single Language

To create a single installer targeting a specific language, set the `language` value to a string:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "wix": {
        "language": "fr-FR"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Compiling a WiX Installer for Each Language in a List

To compile an installer targeting a list of languages, use an array.
A specific installer for each language will be created, with the language key as a suffix:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "wix": {
        "language": ["en-US", "pt-BR", "fr-FR"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Configuring the WiX Installer Strings for Each Language

A configuration object can be defined for each language to configure localization strings:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "wix": {
        "language": {
          "en-US": null,
          "pt-BR": {
            "localePath": "./wix/locales/pt-BR.wxl"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `localePath` property defines the path to a language file, a XML configuring the language culture:

```xml
<WixLocalization
  Culture="en-US"
  xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/2006/localization"
>
  <String Id="LaunchApp"> Launch MyApplicationName </String>
  <String Id="DowngradeErrorMessage">
    A newer version of MyApplicationName is already installed.
  </String>
  <String Id="PathEnvVarFeature">
    Add the install location of the MyApplicationName executable to
    the PATH system environment variable. This allows the
    MyApplicationName executable to be called from any location.
  </String>
  <String Id="InstallAppFeature">
    Installs MyApplicationName.
  </String>
</WixLocalization>
```

:::note

The `WixLocalization` element's `Culture` field must match the configured language.

:::

Currently, Tauri references the following locale strings: `LaunchApp`, `DowngradeErrorMessage`, `PathEnvVarFeature` and `InstallAppFeature`.
You can define your own strings and reference them on your custom template or fragments with `"!(loc.TheStringId)"`.
See the [WiX localization documentation] for more information.

## Customizing the NSIS Installer

See the [NSIS configuration] for the complete list of customization options.

### Installer Template

The NSIS Installer's `.nsi` script defined by Tauri is configured to work for the common use case
of simple webview-based applications (you can find it [here][default nsis template]).
It uses [handlebars] so the Tauri CLI can brand your installer according to your `tauri.conf.json` definition.
If you need a completely different installer, a custom template file can be configured on [`tauri.bundle.windows.nsis.template`].

### Extending the Installer

If you only need to extend some installation steps you might be able to use installer hooks instead of replacing the entire installer template.

Supported hooks are:

- `NSIS_HOOK_PREINSTALL`: Runs before copying files, setting registry key values and creating shortcuts.
- `NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL`: Runs after the installer has finished copying all files, setting the registry keys and created shortcuts.
- `NSIS_HOOK_PREUNINSTALL`: Runs before removing any files, registry keys and shortcuts.
- `NSIS_HOOK_POSTUNINSTALL`: Runs after files, registry keys and shortcuts have been removed.

For example, create a `hooks.nsi` file in the `src-tauri/windows` folder and define the hooks you need:

```nsh
!macro NSIS_HOOK_PREINSTALL
  MessageBox MB_OK "PreInstall"
!macroend

!macro NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL
  MessageBox MB_OK "PostInstall"
!macroend

!macro NSIS_HOOK_PREUNINSTALL
  MessageBox MB_OK "PreUnInstall"
!macroend

!macro NSIS_HOOK_POSTUNINSTALL
  MessageBox MB_OK "PostUninstall"
!macroend
```

Then you must configure Tauri to use that hook file:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "nsis": {
        "installerHooks": "./windows/hooks.nsi"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Install Modes

By default the installer will install your application for the current user only.
The advantage of this option is that the installer does not require Administrator privileges to run,
but the app is installed in the `%LOCALAPPDATA%` folder instead of `C:/Program Files`.

If you prefer your app installation to be available system-wide (which requires Administrator privileges)
you can set [installMode] to `perMachine`:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "nsis": {
        "installMode": "perMachine"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively you can let the user choose whether the app should be installed for the current user only or system-wide
by setting the [installMode] to `both`.
Note that the installer will require Administrator privileges to execute.

See [NSISInstallerMode] for more information.

### Internationalization

The NSIS Installer is a multi-language installer, which means you always have a single installer which contains all the selected translations.

You can specify which languages to include using the [`tauri.bundle.windows.nsis.languages`](/reference/config/#languages) property.
A list of languages supported by NSIS is available in [the NSIS GitHub project].
There are a few [Tauri-specific translations] required, so if you see untranslated texts feel free to open a feature request in [Tauri's main repo].
You can also provide [custom translation files](/reference/config/#customlanguagefiles).

By default the operating system default language is used to determine the installer language.
You can also configure the installer to display a language selector before the installer contents are rendered:

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "nsis": {
        "displayLanguageSelector": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Minimum Webview2 version

If your app requires features only available in newer Webview2 versions (such as custom URI schemes), you can instruct the Windows installer
to verify the current Webview2 version and run the Webview2 bootstrapper if it does not match the target version.

```json title="tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "nsis": {
        "minimumWebview2Version": "110.0.1531.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
