The [Apple App Store] is the app marketplace maintained by Apple.
You can distribute your Tauri app targeting macOS and iOS via this App Store.

This guide only covers details for distributing apps directly to the App Store.
See the general [App Bundle][App Bundle distribution guide] for more information on macOS distribution options and configurations.

## Requirements

Distributing iOS and macOS apps requires enrolling to the [Apple Developer] program.

Additionally, you must setup code signing for [macOS][macOS code signing] and [iOS][iOS code signing].

## Changing App Icon

After running `tauri ios init` to setup the Xcode project, you can use the `tauri icon` command to update the app icons.

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png --ios-color #fff"
  yarn="yarn tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png --ios-color #fff"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png --ios-color #fff"
  cargo="cargo tauri icon /path/to/app-icon.png --ios-color #fff"
/>

The `--ios-color` argument defines the background color for the iOS icons.

## Setting up

After enrolling to the Apple Developer program, the first step to distribute your Tauri app in the App Store
is to register your app in the [App Store Connect][app-store-connect-apps].

:::note
The value provided in the _Bundle ID_ field **must** match the identifier defined in [`tauri.conf.json > identifier`].
:::

## Build and upload

The Tauri CLI can package your app for macOS and iOS. Running on a macOS machine is a requirement.

:::caution
Code signing is required. See the documentation for [macOS][macOS code signing] and [iOS][iOS code signing].
:::

Note that Tauri leverages Xcode for the iOS app so you can use Xcode to archive and distribute for iOS instead of the Tauri CLI.
To open the iOS project in Xcode for building you must run the following command:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri ios build --open"
  yarn="yarn tauri ios build --open"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri ios build --open"
  cargo="cargo tauri ios build --open"
/>

### macOS

To upload your app to the App Store, first you must ensure all required configuration options are set
so you can package the App Bundle, create a signed `.pkg` file and upload it.

The following sections will guide you through the process.

#### Setup

Your app must include some configurations to be accepted by the App Store verification system.

:::tip
The following sections guides you through configuring your app for App Store submissions.

To apply the following config changes only when building for App Store, you can create a separate Tauri configuration file:

```json title="src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "entitlements": "./Entitlements.plist",
      "files": {
        "embedded.provisionprofile": "path/to/profile-name.provisionprofile"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then merge that config file with the main one when bundling your Tauri app for App Store:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri build --no-bundle
npm run tauri bundle --bundles app --target universal-apple-darwin --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
  yarn="yarn tauri build --no-bundle
yarn tauri bundle --bundles app --target universal-apple-darwin --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri build --no-bundle
pnpm tauri bundle --bundles app --target universal-apple-darwin --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
  cargo="cargo tauri build --no-bundle
cargo tauri bundle --bundles app --target universal-apple-darwin --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json"
/>

This is particularly useful when setting up your CI/CD to upload your app to the App Store while not requiring the provision profile locally or
when compiling the app for distribution outside the App Store.

:::

- Category

Your app must define its [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > category`] to be displayed in the App Store:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={3}
{
  "bundle": {
    "category": "Utility"
  }
}
```

- Provisioning profile

You must also create a provisioning profile for your app to be accepted by Apple.

In the [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) page,
create a new App ID and make sure its "Bundle ID" value matches the identifier set in [`tauri.conf.json > identifier`].

Navigate to the [Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list) page to create a new provisioning profile.
For App Store macOS distribution, it must be a "Mac App Store Connect" profile.
Select the appropriate App ID and link the certificate you are using for code signing.

After creating the provisioning profile, download it and save it to a known location and configure Tauri to include it in your app bundle:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={4-6}
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "files": {
        "embedded.provisionprofile": "path/to/profile-name.provisionprofile"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Info.plist

Your app must comply with encryption export regulations.
See the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/complying-with-encryption-export-regulations?language=objc)
for more information.

Create a Info.plist file in the src-tauri folder:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption</key>
	<false/> # or `true` if your app uses encryption
  <key>DTPlatformName</key>
	<string>macosx</string>
	<key>DTSDKBuild</key>
	<string>23E208</string>
	<key>DTSDKName</key>
	<string>macosx14.4</string>
	<key>DTXcode</key>
	<string>1530</string>
	<key>DTXcodeBuild</key>
	<string>15E204a</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

- Entitlements

Your app must include the App Sandbox capability to be distributed in the App Store.
Additionally, you must also set your App ID and Team ID in the code signing entitlements.

Create a `Entitlements.plist` file in the `src-tauri` folder:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.application-identifier</key>
    <string>$TEAM_ID.$IDENTIFIER</string>
    <key>com.apple.developer.team-identifier</key>
    <string>$TEAM_ID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Note that you must replace `$IDENTIFIER` with the [`tauri.conf.json > identifier`] value
and `$TEAM_ID` with your Apple Developer team ID, which can be found in the `App ID Prefix` section in the
[Identifier](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) you created for the provisioning profile.

And reference that file in the macOS bundle configuration [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > entitlements`]:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={4}
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "entitlements": "./Entitlements.plist"
    }
  }
}
```

You now must build your application with code signing enabled for the entitlements to apply.

Make sure your app works when running in an App Sandbox context.

#### Build

You must upload your macOS application as a `.pkg` file to the App Store.
Run the following command to package your app as a macOS App Bundle (`.app` extension):

```
tauri build --bundles app --target universal-apple-darwin
```

:::note
The above command creates an Universal App Binary application, supporting both Apple Silicon and Intel processors.

If you prefer to only support Apple Silicon instead, you must change [`tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > minimumSystemVersion`] to `12.0`:

```json title="tauri.conf.json" ins={4}
{
  "bundle": {
    "macOS": {
      "minimumSystemVersion": "12.0"
    }
  }
}
```

And change the CLI command and output path based on the Mac system you are running:

- if your build system uses an Apple Silicon chip, remove the `--target universal-apple-darwin` arguments and use `target/release`
  instead of `target/universal-apple-darwin/release` in the paths referenced below.
- if your build system uses an Intel chip:
  - install the Rust Apple Silicon target:
    ```
    rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
    ```
  - change the `universal-apple-darwin` argument to `aarch64-apple-darwin`
    and use `target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release` instead of `target/universal-apple-darwin/release` in the paths referenced below.

:::

See the [App Bundle distribution guide] for more information on configuration options.

To generate a signed `.pkg` from your app bundle, run the following command:

```
xcrun productbuild --sign "<certificate signing identity>" --component "target/universal-apple-darwin/release/bundle/macos/$APPNAME.app" /Applications "$APPNAME.pkg"
```

Note that you must replace _$APPNAME_ with your app name.

:::note
You must sign the PKG with a _Mac Installer Distribution_ signing certificate.
:::

#### Upload

Now you can use the [`altool`] CLI to upload your app PKG to the App Store:

```
xcrun altool --upload-app --type macos --file "$APPNAME.pkg" --apiKey $APPLE_API_KEY_ID --apiIssuer $APPLE_API_ISSUER
```

Note that `altool` requires an App Store Connect API key to upload your app.
See the [authentication section] for more information.

Your app will then be validated by Apple and available in TestFlight if approved.

### iOS

To build your iOS app, run the `tauri ios build` command:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm run tauri ios build --export-method app-store-connect"
  yarn="yarn tauri ios build --export-method app-store-connect"
  pnpm="pnpm tauri ios build --export-method app-store-connect"
  cargo="cargo tauri ios build --export-method app-store-connect"
/>

The generated IPA file can be found in `src-tauri/gen/apple/build/arm64/$APPNAME.ipa`.

Note that you must replace _$APPNAME_ with your app name.

Now you can use the `altool` CLI to upload your iOS app to the App Store:

```
xcrun altool --upload-app --type ios --file "src-tauri/gen/apple/build/arm64/$APPNAME.ipa" --apiKey $APPLE_API_KEY_ID --apiIssuer $APPLE_API_ISSUER
```

Note that `altool` requires an App Store Connect API key to upload your app.
See the [authentication section] for more information.

Your app will then be validated by Apple and available in TestFlight if approved.

### Authentication

The iOS and macOS apps are uploaded using `altool`, which uses an App Store Connect API key to authenticate.

To create a new API key, open the [App Store Connect's Users and Access page], select the Integrations > Individual Keys tab, click on the Add button and select a name and the Developer access.
The `APPLE_API_ISSUER` (Issuer ID) is presented above the keys table, and the `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` is the value on the Key ID column on that table.
You also need to download the private key, which can only be done once and is only visible after a page reload (the button is shown on the table row for the newly created key).
The private key file path must be saved as `AuthKey\_<APPLE_API_KEY_ID>.p8` in one of these directories:`<current-working-directory>/private_keys`, `~/private_keys`, `~/.private_keys`or`~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys`.
