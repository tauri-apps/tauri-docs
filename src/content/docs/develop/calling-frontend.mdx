This document includes guides on how to communicate with your application frontend from your Rust code.
To see how to communicate with your Rust code from your frontend, see [Calling Rust from the Frontend].

The Rust side of your Tauri application can call the frontend by leveraging the Tauri event system,
using channels or directly evaluating JavaScript code.

## Event System

Tauri ships a simple event system you can use to have bi-directional communication between Rust and your frontend.

The event system was designed for situations where small amounts of data need to be streamed
or you need to implement a multi consumer multi producer pattern (e.g. push notification system).

The event system is not designed for low latency or high throughput situations.
See the [channels section](#channels) for the implementation optimized for streaming data.

The major differences between a Tauri command and a Tauri event are that events have no strong type support,
event payloads are always JSON strings making them not suitable for bigger messages
and there is no support of the [capabilities] system to fine grain control event data and channels.

The [AppHandle] and [WebviewWindow] types implement the event system traits [Listener] and [Emitter].

Events are either global (delivered to all listeners) or webview-specific (only delivered to the webview matching a given label).

### Global Events

To trigger a global event you can use the [Emitter#emit] function:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
use tauri::{AppHandle, Emitter};

#[tauri::command]
fn download(app: AppHandle, url: String) {
  app.emit("download-started", &url).unwrap();
  for progress in [1, 15, 50, 80, 100] {
    app.emit("download-progress", 10).unwrap();
  }
  app.emit("download-finished", &url).unwrap();
}
```

:::note
Global events are delivered to **all** listeners
:::

### Webview Event

To trigger an event to a listener registered by a specific webview you can use the [Emitter#emit_to] function:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
use tauri::{AppHandle, Emitter};

#[tauri::command]
fn login(app: AppHandle, user: String, password: String) {
  let authenticated = user == "tauri-apps" && password == "tauri";
  let result = if authenticated { "loggedIn" } else { "invalidCredentials" };
  app.emit_to("login", "login-result", result).unwrap();
}
```

It is also possible to trigger an event to a list of webviews by calling [Emitter#emit_filter].
In the following example we emit a open-file event to the main and file-viewer webviews:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
use tauri::{AppHandle, Emitter, EventTarget};

#[tauri::command]
fn open_file(app: AppHandle, path: std::path::PathBuf) {
  app.emit_filter("open-file", path, |target| match target {
    EventTarget::WebviewWindow { label } => label == "main" || label == "file-viewer",
  }).unwrap();
}
```

:::note
Webview-specific events are **not** triggered to regular global event listeners.
To listen to **any** event you must use the `listen_any` function instead of `listen`,
which defines the listener to act as a catch-all for emitted events.
:::

### Event Payload

The event payload can be any [serializable][Serialize] type that also implements [Clone].
Let's enhance the download event example by using an object to emit more information in each event:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
use tauri::{AppHandle, Emitter};
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Clone, Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
struct DownloadStarted<'a> {
  url: &'a str,
  download_id: usize,
  content_length: usize,
}

#[derive(Clone, Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
struct DownloadProgress {
  download_id: usize,
  chunk_length: usize,
}

#[derive(Clone, Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
struct DownloadFinished {
  download_id: usize,
}

#[tauri::command]
fn download(app: AppHandle, url: String) {
  let content_length = 1000;
  let download_id = 1;

  app.emit("download-started", DownloadStarted {
    url: &url,
    download_id,
    content_length
  }).unwrap();

  for chunk_length in [15, 150, 35, 500, 300] {
    app.emit("download-progress", DownloadProgress {
      download_id,
      chunk_length,
    }).unwrap();
  }

  app.emit("download-finished", DownloadFinished { download_id }).unwrap();
}
```

### Listening to Events

Tauri provides APIs to listen to events on both the webview and the Rust interfaces.

#### Listening to Events on the Frontend

<FrontendListen />

## Channels

The event system is designed to be a simple two way communication that is globally available in your application.
Under the hood it directly evaluates JavaScript code so it might not be suitable to sending a large amount of data.

Channels are designed to be fast and deliver ordered data. They are used internally for streaming operations
such as download progress, child process output and WebSocket messages.

Let's rewrite our download command example to use channels instead of the event system:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
use tauri::{AppHandle, ipc::Channel};
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Clone, Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase", tag = "event", content = "data")]
enum DownloadEvent<'a> {
  #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
  Started {
    url: &'a str,
    download_id: usize,
    content_length: usize,
  },
  #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
  Progress {
    download_id: usize,
    chunk_length: usize,
  },
  #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
  Finished {
    download_id: usize,
  },
}

#[tauri::command]
fn download(app: AppHandle, url: String, on_event: Channel<DownloadEvent>) {
  let content_length = 1000;
  let download_id = 1;

  on_event.send(DownloadEvent::Started {
    url: &url,
    download_id,
    content_length,
  }).unwrap();

  for chunk_length in [15, 150, 35, 500, 300] {
    on_event.send(DownloadEvent::Progress {
      download_id,
      chunk_length,
    }).unwrap();
  }

  on_event.send(DownloadEvent::Finished { download_id }).unwrap();
}
```

When calling the download command you must create the channel and provide it as an argument:

```ts
import { invoke, Channel } from '@tauri-apps/api/core';

type DownloadEvent =
  | {
      event: 'started';
      data: {
        url: string;
        downloadId: number;
        contentLength: number;
      };
    }
  | {
      event: 'progress';
      data: {
        downloadId: number;
        chunkLength: number;
      };
    }
  | {
      event: 'finished';
      data: {
        downloadId: number;
      };
    };

const onEvent = new Channel<DownloadEvent>();
onEvent.onmessage = (message) => {
  console.log(`got download event ${message.event}`);
};

await invoke('download', {
  url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tauri-apps/tauri/dev/crates/tauri-schema-generator/schemas/config.schema.json',
  onEvent,
});
```

## Evaluating JavaScript

To directly execute any JavaScript code on the webview context you can use the [`WebviewWindow#eval`] function:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
use tauri::Manager;

tauri::Builder::default()
  .setup(|app| {
    let webview = app.get_webview_window("main").unwrap();
    webview.eval("console.log('hello from Rust')")?;
    Ok(())
  })
```

If the script to be evaluated is not so simple and must use input from Rust objects we recommend using the [serialize-to-javascript] crate.
