Trunk is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. Learn more about Trunk at https://trunkrs.dev. This guide is accurate as of Trunk 0.17.5.

## Checklist

- Use SSG, Tauri doesn't officially support server based solutions.
- Use `address = "0.0.0.0"` so that the webserver is available on the network for mobile development.
- Use `ws_protocol = "ws"` so that the hot-reload websocket can connect properly for mobile development.
- Enable `withGlobalTauri` to ensure that Tauri APIs are available in the `window.__TAURI__` variable and can be imported using `wasm-bindgen`.

## Example Configuration

1. Update Tauri configuration:

```json
// tauri.conf.json
{
	"build": {
		"beforeDevCommand": "trunk serve",
		"beforeBuildCommand": "trunk build",
		"devPath": "http://localhost:8080",
		"distDir": "../dist"
	},
	"app": {
		"withGlobalTauri": true
	}
}
```

2. Update Trunk configuration:

```toml
# Trunk.toml
[watch]
ignore = ["./src-tauri"]

[serve]
address = "0.0.0.0"
ws_protocol = "ws"
```
