In this guide we are going to package a Node.js application to a self contained binary
to be used as a sidecar in a Tauri application without requiring the end user to have a Node.js installation.
This example tutorial is applicable for desktop operating systems only.

We recommend reading the general [sidecar guide] first for a deeper understanding of how Tauri sidecars work.

In this example we will create a Node.js application that reads input from the command line [process.argv]
and writes output to stdout using [console.log]. <br/>
You can leverage alternative inter-process communication systems such as a localhost server, stdin/stdout or local sockets.
Note that each has their own advantages, drawbacks and security concerns.

## Prerequisites

:::note
Please follow the [shell plugin guide](/plugin/shell/) first to set up and initialize the plugin correctly.
Without the plugin being initialized and configured the example won't work.
:::

You need an existing Tauri application that compiles and runs for you locally.

:::tip[Create a lab app]

If you are not an advanced user it's **highly recommended** that you use the options and frameworks provided here. It's just a lab, you can delete the project when you're done.

<CTA/>

- Project name: `node-sidecar-lab`
- Choose which language to use for your frontend: `Typescript / Javascript`
- Choose your package manager: `pnpm`
- Choose your UI template: `Vanilla`
- Choose your UI flavor: `Typescript`
- Would you like to setup the project for mobile as well? `yes`

<Steps>

1. ##### Initialize Sidecar Project

  Let's create a new Node.js project to contain our sidecar implementation.
  Create a new directory (in this example we will call it `sidecar-app`)
  and run the `init` command of your preferred Node.js package manager inside the directory:

  <CommandTabs npm="npm init" yarn="yarn init" pnpm="pnpm init" />

  We will compile our Node.js application to a self container binary using [pkg].
  Let's install it as a development dependency:

  <CommandTabs
    npm="npm add pkg --save-dev"
    yarn="yarn add pkg --dev"
    pnpm="pnpm add pkg --save-dev"
  />

1. ##### Write Sidecar Logic

  Now we can start writing JavaScript code that will be executed by our Tauri application.

  In this example we will process a command from the command line argmuents and write output to stdout,
  which means our process will be short lived and only handle a single command at a time.
  If your application must be long lived, consider using alternative inter-process communication systems.

  Let's create a `index.js` file in our `sidecar-app` directory and write a basic Node.js app:

  ```js title=sidecar-app/index.js
  const command = process.argv[2];

  switch (command) {
    case 'ping':
      const message = process.argv[3];
      console.log(`pong, ${message}`);
      break;
    default:
      console.error(`unknown command ${command}`);
      process.exit(1);
  }
  ```

1. ##### Package the Sidecar

  To package our Node.js application to a self contained binary, we can run the following `pkg` command:

  <CommandTabs
    npm="npm run pkg -- --output app"
    yarn="yarn pkg --output app"
    pnpm="pnpm pkg --output app"
  />

  This will create the `sidecar-app/app` binary on Linux and macOS, and a `sidecar-app/app.exe` executable on Windows.
  To rename this file to the expected Tauri sidecar filename, we can use the following Node.js script:

  ```js
  import { execSync } from 'child_process';
  import fs from 'fs';

  const ext = process.platform === 'win32' ? '.exe' : '';

  const rustInfo = execSync('rustc -vV');
  const targetTriple = /host: (\S+)/g.exec(rustInfo)[1];
  if (!targetTriple) {
    console.error('Failed to determine platform target triple');
  }
  fs.renameSync(`app${ext}`, `../src-tauri/binaries/app-${targetTriple}${ext}`);
  ```

1. ##### configure the Sidecar in the Tauri Application

  Now that we have our Node.js application ready, we can connect it to our Tauri application
  by configuring the [`bundle > externalBin`] array:

  ```json title="src-tauri/tauri.conf.json"
  {
    "bundle": {
      "externalBin": ["binaries/app"]
    }
  }
  ```

The Tauri CLI will handle the bundling of the sidecar binary as long as it exists as `src-tauri/binaries/app-<target-triple>`.

1. ##### Execute the Sidecar

  We can run the sidecar binary either from Rust code or directly from JavaScript.

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    
    Let's execute the `ping` command in the Node.js sidecar directly:

  ```javascript
  import { Command } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-shell';

  const message = 'Tauri';

  const command = Command.sidecar('binaries/app', ['ping', message]);
  const output = await command.execute();
  const response = output.stdout;
  ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Rust">

  Let's pipe a `ping` Tauri command to the Node.js sidecar:

  ```rust
  #[tauri::command]
  async fn ping(app: tauri::AppHandle, message: String) -> String {
    let sidecar_command = app
      .shell()
      .sidecar("app")
      .unwrap()
      .arg("ping")
      .arg(message);
    let output = sidecar_command.output().unwrap();
    let response = String::from_utf8(output.stdout).unwrap();
    response
  }
  ```
