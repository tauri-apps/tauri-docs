The Tauri team is happy to announce the 1.7 release. This version includes several bug fixes, performance improvements and features backported from the upcoming v2 release.

## Upgrading

Make sure to update both NPM and Cargo dependencies to the 1.7.0 release. You can update the dependencies with:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm install @tauri-apps/cli@latest @tauri-apps/api@latest"
  yarn="yarn upgrade @tauri-apps/cli @tauri-apps/api --latest"
  pnpm="pnpm update @tauri-apps/cli @tauri-apps/api --latest"
  cargo="cargo update"
/>

## What's in 1.7.0

### Shell API performance improvement

The shell's `Command::execute` API has been optimized to only use the IPC a single time instead of streaming data, improving usage of verbose shell scripts.

### Feature backport from v2

Thanks to community effort we have backported a few bundler features from v2 into the v1 release.

#### Custom Windows codesign script

By default the Windows packaging uses [SignTool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/signtool), which only works on Windows so it's not useful when cross compiling.
In this release we have backported the custom sign command feature, which allows using `osslsigncode`, `relic` and other alternatives that can run on Unix systems and support hardware tokens, Azure Key Vault and more.

#### RPM bundle

RPM packaging have been available to Tauri v2 users for a while, and it is now also available on the v1 channel.

### DMG configuration

DMG installers are now configurable: you can change the position of the icons and the window size to fit better within a custom background.
