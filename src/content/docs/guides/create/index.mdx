One thing that makes Tauri so flexible is it's ability to work with virtually any frontend framework. We've created the [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app) utility to help you create a new Tauri project using one of the officially maintained framework templates.

`create-tauri-app` currently includes templates for vanilla (HTML, CSS and JavaScript without a framework), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Yew](https://yew.rs/), [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos), and [Sycamore](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/). You can also find or add your own community templates and frameworks in the [Awesome Tauri repo](https://github.com/tauri-apps/awesome-tauri).

Alternatively, you can [add Tauri to an existing project](/guides/create/existing-project) to quickly turn your existing codebase into a Tauri app.

## Using `create-tauri-app`

To get started using `create-tauri-app` run one of the below commands in the folder you'd like to setup your project. If you're not sure which command to use we recommend the Bash command on Linux and macOS and the PowerShell command on Windows.

<Cta />

Follow along with the prompts to choose your project name, frontend language, package manager, and frontend framework, and frontend framework options if applicable.

:::tip[Not sure what to choose?]

We recommend starting with the vanilla template (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without a frontend framework) to get started. You can always [integrate a frontend framework](/guides/create/existing-project) later.

- Choose which language to use for your frontend: `TypeScript / JavaScript`
- Choose your package manager: `pnpm`
- Choose your UI template: `Vanilla`
- Choose your UI flavor: `TypeScript`

{/* TODO: Can CTA offer to install the deps? */}

After `create-tauri-app` has complete you can navigate into your project's folder, install dependencies, then use the [Tauri CLI](/references/v2/cli) to start the development server:

<CommandTabs
	npm="cd my-tauri-app
    npm install
    npm run tauri dev"
	yarn="cd my-tauri-app
    yarn install
    yarn tauri dev"
	pnpm="cd my-tauri-app
    pnpm install
    pnpm tauri dev"
	cargo="cd my-tauri-app
    cargo tauri dev"
/>

You'll now see a new window open with your app running.

**Congratulations!** You've made your Tauri app! 🚀

## Manual Setup using the Tauri CLI

To get started manually creating a new Tauri project using the Tauri CLI, follow the steps below:

<Steps>

    1. First install Tauri's CLI tool globally using your package manager of choice:

        <CommandTabs
            npm="npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli"
            yarn="yarn global add @tauri-apps/cli"
            pnpm="pnpm add -g @tauri-apps/cli"
            cargo="cargo install tauri-cli"
        />

    2. Create a new directory for your project and initialize a your app. You can use any frontend framework you prefer, such as Next.js, Nuxt, Svelte, Yew, Leptos, or just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        <CommandTabs
            npm="mkdir my-tauri-app
                cd my-tauri-app
                npm <command to bootstrap a template for your frontend app>"
            yarn="mkdir my-tauri-app
                cd my-tauri-app
                yarn <command to bootstrap a template for your frontend app>"
            pnpm="mkdir my-tauri-app
                cd my-tauri-app
                pnpm <command to bootstrap a template for your frontend app>"
        />

    3. In your project directory, initialize Tauri:

        ```bash
        tauri init
        ```

        After running the command it will display a prompt asking you for different options. Here you have an example:

        ```md
        ✔ What is your app name? my-tauri-app
        ✔ What should the window title be? my-tauri-app
        ✔ Where are your web assets (HTML/CSS/JS) located, relative to the "<current dir>/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json" file that will be created? ../build
        ✔ What is the url of your dev server? http://localhost:3000
        ✔ What is your frontend dev command? pnpm run dev
        ✔ What is your frontend build command? pnpm run build
        ```

        :::tip
        Make sure that the url of the dev server is the same as the one you use to run your frontend app.
        :::

        This will create a `src-tauri` directory in your project with the necessary Tauri configuration files.

    4. Develop your frontend application as you would normally. Tauri acts as a backend, so your main focus will be on the web technologies.

    5. Edit `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` to configure Tauri. You can set application window size, permissions, and other settings here.

    6. Verify your Tauri app is working by running the development server:

        <CommandTabs
            npm="npm run tauri dev"
            yarn="yarn tauri dev"
            pnpm="pnpm tauri dev"
            cargo="cargo tauri dev"
        />

        This command will compile the Rust code and open a window with your web content.

</Steps>

**Congratulations!** You've created a new Tauri project using the Tauri CLI! 🚀
