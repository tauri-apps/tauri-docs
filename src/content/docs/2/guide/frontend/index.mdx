Tauri is frontend agnostic and supports most frontend frameworks out of the box. But sometimes frameworks need a bit of extra configuration to integrate with Tauri. Below is a list of frameworks with recommended configurations.

If a framework is not listed then it could either work with Tauri with no additional configuration needed or it could have not been documented yet. Any contributions to add a framework that may require additional configuration is welcome to help others in the Tauri community integrate with that framework.

:::tip[Framework Not Listed?]

Don't see a framework listed? It may work with Tauri without any additional configuration required. Read the [configuration checklist](#configuration-checklist) for any common configurations to check for.

## Configuration Checklist

For all intents and purposes you can think of Tauri as a static web host, and you have to provide Tauri with a folder
containing some mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript and possibly WASM that can be served to the webview Tauri provides.

{/* TODO: Link to core concept of SSG/SSR, etc. */}
{/* TODO: Link to mobile development server guide */}
{/* TODO: Concept of how to do a client-server relationship? */}

- Use static site generation (SSG). Tauri doesn't officially support any server based alternatives (SSR).
- For mobile development, a development server of some kind is necessary that can host the frontend on your internal IP.
- Use a proper client-server relationship between your app and your API's (no hybrid solutions with SSR).
