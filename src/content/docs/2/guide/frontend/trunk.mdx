Trunk is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. Learn more about Trunk at https://trunkrs.dev. This guide is accurate as of Trunk 0.17.5.

:::caution[Note on Mobile Support]

Tauri mobile development is not currently possible with the official version of Trunk. If developing for mobile you will need to use https://github.com/amrbashir/trunk until https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/pull/494 and https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/pull/500 are merged and released.

You will need to use `cargo install --git https://github.com/amrbashir/trunk` when installing Trunk and then set `serve.ws_protocol = "ws"` in `Trunk.toml`.

## Checklist

- Use SSG, Tauri doesn't officially support server based solutions.
- Use `address = "0.0.0.0"` so that the webserver is available on the network for mobile development.

## Example Configuration

1. Update Tauri configuration:

```json
// tauri.conf.json
{
	"build": {
		"beforeDevCommand": "trunk serve",
		"beforeBuildCommand": "trunk build",
		"devPath": "http://localhost:1420",
		"distDir": "../dist",
		"withGlobalTauri": true
	}
}
```

2. Update Trunk configuration:

```toml
# Trunk.toml
