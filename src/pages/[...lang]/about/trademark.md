# Trademark Guidelines

![Tauri Logos](/img/tauri-trademark-page.jpg)

<pre>Version 1.0 dated 20th, August 2022</pre>

This trademark policy was prepared to help you understand how to use the TAURI trademarks, service marks and logos owned by the Tauri Programme within the Commons Conservancy.  

While our software is available under a free and open source software license, that copyright license does not include a license to use our trademark, and this Policy is intended to explain how to use our marks consistent with background law and community expectation.

**This Policy covers:**
- Our word trademarks and service marks: TAURI, TAO, WRY
- Our logos: The TAURI, TAO, WRY logos (and all visual derivatives)

This policy encompasses all trademarks and service marks, whether they are registered or not.

## GENERAL GUIDELINES
Whenever you use one of our marks, you must always do so in a way that does not mislead anyone about what they are getting and from whom. For example, you cannot say you are distributing TAURI software when you’re distributing a modified version of it (aka a Fork), because recipients may not understand the differences between your modified versions and our own.

You also cannot use our logo on your website in a way that suggests that your website is an official website or that we endorse your website. 

You can, though, say you like TAURI software, that you participate in the TAURI community, that you are providing an unmodified version of the TAURI software.

You may not use or register our marks, or variations of them as part of your own trademark, service mark, domain name, company name, trade name, product name or service name.

Trademark law does not allow your use of names or trademarks that are too similar to ours. You therefore may not use an obvious variation of any of our marks or any phonetic equivalent, foreign language equivalent, takeoff, or abbreviation for a similar or compatible product or service. We would consider the following too similar to one of our Marks:

- TAURIMAGE
- Tauri Wallet App

## ACCEPTABLE USES

### Applications
TAURI is a framework for making applications for computing devices. You may claim that your application uses TAURI, but care should be taken to avoid giving the impression that your application is approved by The Tauri Programme within the Commons Conservancy, or is an official application. Care must be taken, not to ship your application with the default ICON.

### Plugins & Templates
You may publish the code for plugins and templates using the appropriate naming conventions, but please mention that these works are not officially approved. Only such codebases that are managed by the organization within the GitHub organization `tauri-apps` are considered official.

## Core Modifications (forks)
If you distribute a modified version of our software (TAURI CORE), you must remove all of our logos and naming from it. You must retain our original license in SPDX format. You may use our word marks, but not our logos, to truthfully describe the origin of the software that you are providing. For example, if the code you are distributing is a modification of our software, you may say, “This software is derived from the source code for TAURI software.”

### Statements about compatibility
You may use the word marks, but not the logos, to truthfully describe the relationship between your software and ours. Any other use may imply that we have certified or approved your software. If you wish to use our logos, please contact us to discuss license terms.

### Naming Compatible Products 
If you wish to describe your product with reference to the TAURI software, here are the conditions under which you may do so. You may call your software XYZ (where XYZ is your product name) for TAURI only if:

- All versions of the TAURI software you deliver with your product are the exact binaries provided by us, or manufactured by the core software and tooling we provide.
- Your product is fully compatible with the APIs for the TAURI software.
- You use the following legend in marketing materials or product descriptions: “TAURI is a trademark of The Tauri Programme within the Commons Conservancy. [https://tauri.app/]”

### User groups
You can use the Word Marks as part of your user group name provided that:

- The main focus of the group is our software
- The group does not make a profit
- Any charge to attend meetings are to cover the cost of the venue, food and drink only

You are not authorized to conduct a conference using our marks.

### No Domain Names
You must not register any domain that includes our word marks or any variant or combination of them.

### Other For Profit Usage of the TAURI marks
If you are making a video, tutorial series, book, or other educational material, for which you are receiving payment through subscriptions, sales, advertising or the like, then you must acquire explicit licensing permission from The Tauri Programme within the Commons Conservancy.

## HOW TO DISPLAY OUR MARKS
When you have the right to use our mark, here is how to display it. 

### Trademark marking and legends
The first or most prominent mention of a mark on a webpage, document, or documentation should be accompanied by a symbol indicating whether the mark is a registered trademark (“®”) or an unregistered trademark (“™”). If you don’t know which applies, contact us. (TAURI itself is a registered trademark.)

Place the following notice at the foot of the page where you have used the mark: TAURI is trademark of [The Tauri Programme within the Commons Conservancy].”

### Use of trademarks in text
Always use trademarks in their exact form with the correct spelling, neither abbreviated, hyphenated, or combined with any other word or words.
- Unacceptable: TAUREE
- Acceptable: TAURI

Don’t pluralize a trademark.
- Unacceptable: I have seventeen TAURIs running on my computer.
- Acceptable: I am running seventeen TAURI applications on my computer and have ram to spare.

Always use a trademark as an adjective modifying a noun. 
- Unacceptable: This is a TAURI. 
- Acceptable: This is a TAURI software application.

### Use of Logos
You may not change any logo except to scale it. This means you may not add decorative elements, change the colors, change the proportions, distort it, add elements, or combine it with other logos.

We have a high-contrast version of the logo, which you can download below in the assets section.
